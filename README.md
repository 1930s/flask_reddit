flask\_reddit
============

An extendable Reddit clone built with flask by Lucas Ou-Yang and Jason Tanner.

This build is missing one file. A `config.py` file in the currect directory. This
file contains application sensetive information but can be easily replicated for 
personal use.


Refer to the flask project configuration options to understand what to put in your own
config.py file.
